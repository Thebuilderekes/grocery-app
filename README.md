# Grocery app

## Features

- An input field to accept item name
- Add button to add item to a list of grocery items

### How does it work?

Users are able to create a list of items by typing into the input field and then using the "Add to cart" button to add items to a list

## challenges that I faced and solution

At first I ran into an issue trying to get firebase URL to work with using the import keyword and I had error with ESM and identifying my file as a module. Thi I decided to create the file loccally and use it in the project instead and this solved the issue.
